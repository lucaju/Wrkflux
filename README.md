Wrkflux Beta 2
=======

Instructions
-------

There is no need to have an account to use Workflux.

However, if you want to save you own workflows, you must register yourself. Your workflows will carry your name and you will be able to edit and delete your own workflows whenever you want.


Initial Screen
-------

Choose between create a new Workflow or load a previous existing one.
If you choose load, a list of previous workflow will show up. 
Choose one workflow to load in “use mode”.
Mouse over on each item to see the option “edit”. By clicking on this option the user goes to “build mode,” where he can edit the structure.



Build Mode
-------

If you are creating a new workflow, give it a title before you start (required).

###FLAGS

Use the button “+” at the bottom to add up to 6 flags.

Reorder them by dragging a flag up and down on the list.

Change a flag colour by clicking on the ball.

Change a flag title editing its label.
